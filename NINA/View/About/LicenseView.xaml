            The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<LineBreak />
            become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<LineBreak />
            distributes such Contribution.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<LineBreak />

            <LineBreak />

            (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's<LineBreak />
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<LineBreak />

            2.5. Representation<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />

            -------------------<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            3.1. Distribution of Source Form<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<LineBreak />
            Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<LineBreak />
            the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<LineBreak />
            Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<LineBreak />
            License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<LineBreak />
            attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<LineBreak />
            Form.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<LineBreak />
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<LineBreak />
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<LineBreak />
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<LineBreak />
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<LineBreak />
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<LineBreak />
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<LineBreak />
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<LineBreak />
            provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<LineBreak />
            the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<LineBreak />
            Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<LineBreak />
            Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<LineBreak />
            License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<LineBreak />
            under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<LineBreak />
            the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<LineBreak />
            Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<LineBreak />
            License(s).<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            3.4. Notices<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<LineBreak />
            (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<LineBreak />
            or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<LineBreak />
            the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<LineBreak />
            the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            3.5. Application of Additional Terms<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<LineBreak />
            indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<LineBreak />
            Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<LineBreak />
            behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<LineBreak />
            such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<LineBreak />
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<LineBreak />
            liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<LineBreak />
            indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<LineBreak />
            disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<LineBreak />
            jurisdiction.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<LineBreak />
            ---------------------------------------------------<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<LineBreak />
            License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<LineBreak />
            statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<LineBreak />
            the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<LineBreak />
            describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<LineBreak />
            be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<LineBreak />
            Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<LineBreak />
            or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<LineBreak />
            recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            5. Termination<LineBreak />
            --------------<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<LineBreak />
            if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<LineBreak />
            compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<LineBreak />
            Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<LineBreak />
            Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<LineBreak />
            ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<LineBreak />
            non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<LineBreak />
            come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<LineBreak />
            Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<LineBreak />
            notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<LineBreak />
            first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<LineBreak />
            from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<LineBreak />
            Your receipt of the notice.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<LineBreak />
            infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<LineBreak />
            counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<LineBreak />
            directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<LineBreak />
            You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<LineBreak />
            2.1 of this License shall terminate.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<LineBreak />
            end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<LineBreak />
            have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<LineBreak />
            prior to termination shall survive termination.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
