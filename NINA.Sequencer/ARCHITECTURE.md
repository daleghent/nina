# NINA.Sequencer Architecture

## Purpose

`NINA.Sequencer` contains the advanced sequencing engine: the sequence tree model, runtime execution pipeline, serialization layer, target/template storage, and the expression/symbol infrastructure used by sequence entities.

Build shape from `NINA.Sequencer.csproj`:

- Target framework: `net10.0-windows`
- Output type: `Library`
- WPF enabled
- References `NINA.Sequencer.Generators` as an analyzer/source generator
- Emits compiler-generated files

## Top-Level Structure

- `SequenceItem/`
  Concrete executable items grouped by feature area (`Autofocus`, `Camera`, `FilterWheel`, `Focuser`, `Guider`, `Imaging`, `Platesolving`, `Rotator`, `SafetyMonitor`, `Switch`, `Telescope`, `Utility`, `Dome`, `Connect`, `Expressions`)
- `Container/`
  Sequence containers such as `SequenceRootContainer`, `SequentialContainer`, `ParallelContainer`, `TargetAreaContainer`, `StartAreaContainer`, `EndAreaContainer`
- `Conditions/`
  Loop, altitude, sun/moon, time, and safety-monitor conditions
- `Trigger/`
  Trigger types grouped into areas such as `Autofocus`, `Connect`, `Dome`, `Guider`, `MeridianFlip`, and `Platesolving`
- `Serialization/`
  JSON creation converters and `SequenceJsonConverter`
- `Logic/`
  Expression and symbol infrastructure (`Expression`, `SymbolBroker`, `UserSymbol`, expression controls/converters)
- `View/`
  XAML/data templates for sequence UI surfaces

## Execution Model

The runtime entry point is `Sequencer.cs`:

- `Sequencer.Start(...)` validates the root container, initializes every item/condition/trigger, runs the root container, and then tears the tree down again.
- Validation is recursive and based on the `IValidatable` interface.
- Containers, conditions, and triggers are normal runtime objects, not pure data nodes.

The root node is `Container/SequenceRootContainer.cs`, which adds sequence-wide concerns such as:

- tracking currently running items
- failure events
- reset/clear behavior
- change tracking through `HasChanges`

## Entity Discovery Model

The sequence entity palette is not hard-coded in one place. Instead:

- built-in sequence entities are exported with MEF metadata (`[Export]`, `[ExportMetadata]`)
- `NINA.Plugin.PluginLoader` loads both built-in and plugin-provided entities
- `SequencerFactory` receives the final entity lists and exposes cloneable prototypes for UI/editor use

This is why sequence entities must implement clone behavior and provide metadata consistently.

## Serialization Model

`Serialization/SequenceJsonConverter.cs` is the JSON entry point.

Important characteristics:

- serializes with `TypeNameHandling.All` and `PreserveReferencesHandling.All`
- deserializes through creation converters backed by `ISequencerFactory`
- supports containers, items, conditions, triggers, and date-time providers

The deserialization flow is factory-based, so sequence entities are reconstructed from registered prototypes rather than arbitrary reflection alone.

## Target And Template Storage

Two controllers manage user-authored sequence assets:

- `TargetController`
  Watches the target folder from `ISequenceSettings.SequencerTargetsFolder`, loads `.json` target containers, and can add/delete targets.
- `TemplateController`
  Loads built-in templates from `NINA/Sequencer/Examples` and user templates from `ISequenceSettings.SequencerTemplatesFolder`, storing them as `.template.json`.

Both controllers use `SequenceJsonConverter` and `FileSystemWatcher`, so folder layout and file naming are part of the runtime contract.

## Expression And Symbol Infrastructure

The `Logic/` area is a distinct subsystem:

- `SymbolBroker` owns symbols and functions
- `SymbolController` and `SymbolFunctionController` expose live views of broker data
- `Expression` and related controls support expression-backed properties on sequence entities

This subsystem is the reason the project consumes the `NINA.Sequencer.Generators` analyzer.

New expression entities should use `[UsesExpressions(GenerateValidation = true)]`. The generator owns the expression list and existing `IValidatable` implementation; optional preparation and domain-validation hooks retain entity-specific rules. Every `[UsesExpressions]` class also receives a private `ValidateOwnExpressions(issues)` helper for its declared expressions. Containers call it from handwritten validation while keeping child validation and its ordering explicit. Read generated scalar properties when executing or checking conditions so live values are evaluated. Proxy attributes synchronize valid values into stored data. Generated-validation entities already bind expression context during creation, replacement and cloning. Attachment/watchdog ordering remains explicit. See [the generator contract](../NINA.Sequencer.Generators/ARCHITECTURE.md) for diagnostics, hooks and the five container exceptions enforced by tests.

NCalc is an internal expression-engine implementation detail. Public and plugin-facing symbol APIs must use NINA-owned contracts such as `ISymbolFunctionArguments`; they must not expose NCalc types. `ISymbolFunctionArguments.Evaluate(int)` intentionally preserves lazy argument evaluation, so conditional functions should evaluate only the branch they select. Keep NCalc version-specific event arguments and parameter access contained in the internal adapter.

Releasing an expression's symbol consumers must also discard its cached parameter inputs under the same lock. The next evaluation then resolves symbols in the current scope instead of accepting values from a former scope. Release itself does not evaluate or invoke value-change validators. Single-reference invalidation preserves the other references and their inputs.

## Editor History

`Editing/` owns an in-memory journal for configuration edits, with lifetime managed by `Sequence2VM`. It records field and structural changes through the WPF editor and preserves current runtime inputs during replay. Undo does not reverse equipment actions.

See [editor history architecture](Editing/ARCHITECTURE.md) for capture, ownership, replay, plugin contracts and integration tests. The [plugin integration example](Editing/README.md) and [core editor coverage inventory](Editing/UI-COVERAGE.md) cover extension usage and template coverage.

## Dependency Position

Project references:

- `NINA.Core`
- `NINA.Astrometry`
- `NINA.Equipment`
- `NINA.Image`
- `NINA.PlateSolving`
- `NINA.Profile`
- `NINA.CustomControlLibrary`
- `NINA.WPF.Base`
- `NINA.Sequencer.Generators` as an analyzer

The project is referenced by the main app, the plugin layer, the installer, and tests. It is both a runtime engine and a plugin extension surface.

## Contribution Notes

- New sequence entities should live under the matching `SequenceItem`, `Conditions`, `Trigger`, or `Container` area and must implement cloning, parent attachment, and validation correctly.
- Add MEF export metadata (`Name`, `Description`, `Icon`, `Category`) for anything that should appear in the sequencer UI or plugin loader registries.
- Keep JSON compatibility in mind; serialization depends on the existing converters and prototype factory model.
- If you use expression-backed properties, follow the generator-based pattern already used in this project instead of hand-writing the same boilerplate.
- Generated expression properties release their symbol consumers automatically. A hand-written `Expression` owner must release the previous value when replacing it and override `ReleaseExpressionConsumers()` so detaching its sequence graph releases the current value.
