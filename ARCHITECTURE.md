# NINA Solution Architecture

This is the ownership and boundary map for `NINA.sln`. Use it to choose the relevant project document when tracing lifecycle, designing a change or following dependencies. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds repository constraints and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers contributor setup and submission.

## Project Index

The solution project is named `NINA.PlateSolving`; its folder is `NINA.Platesolving`. `Accord.Imaging (NETStandard)` and `nikoncswrapper` are also solution projects and matter during dependency tracing, but have no project architecture documents here.

`NINA.Docs` is a separate git submodule declared in [`.gitmodules`](.gitmodules), outside `NINA.sln`. User documentation changes follow the [documentation contribution route](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-documentation).

## Startup And Composition

1. [NINA/App.xaml.cs](NINA/App.xaml.cs) parses command-line options, initializes user settings, loads/selects the active profile, configures logging/notifications and shows the main window.
2. [NINA/CompositionRoot.cs](NINA/CompositionRoot.cs) builds the application service provider and eagerly resolves major view models/controllers.
3. [NINA/Utility/IoCBindings.cs](NINA/Utility/IoCBindings.cs) registers the DI graph with `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`.
4. [NINA/MainWindow.xaml](NINA/MainWindow.xaml) and its code-behind host the shell.

Start with `IoCBindings.cs` to find where an app-wide service comes from. New services, mediators and first-level view models may need registrations there; shell-consumed objects also involve `CompositionRoot.cs` and dock/equipment composition.

## Cross-Project Boundaries

### Profiles And Database

`IProfileService` is the central runtime configuration service. Typed settings live in `NINA.Profile`; profile changes can invalidate cached settings references, so consumers often subscribe to `ProfileChanged`. New settings involve interfaces, concrete settings, defaults, known types, notifications and persistence compatibility.

The EF6/SQLite context is `NINA.Core.Database.NINADbContext`. Its runtime SQL lives under `NINA/Database`; schema or initialization work usually spans both. Follow the [database migration rules](CONTRIBUTING.md#database-enhancements) for existing installations.

### Plugins And Sequencer Entities

`NINA.Plugin.PluginLoader` loads built-in sequencer/entity types first, scans plugin DLLs from versioned folders under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NINA` and composes items, conditions, triggers, containers, dockable view models, pluggable behaviors and equipment providers through MEF. It also merges plugin resource dictionaries into the WPF application resources.

`NINA.ViewModel.Sequencer.SequenceNavigationVM` waits for plugin loading before building `SequencerFactory`. The factory supplies cloneable prototypes to the editor. `NINA.Sequencer.Serialization.SequenceJsonConverter` deserializes through factory-backed creation converters. A new entity or extension point therefore spans its type, MEF metadata, loader composition, factory creation, clone behavior and JSON compatibility.

Keep runtime plugin scanning and manifest rules in `NINA.Plugin`. Expression generation and editor history have their own contracts linked from the project index.

### Shared UI And Mediators

Lower-level code communicates upward through mediator interfaces. Implementations live in `NINA.WPF.Base/Mediator`; `NINA/Utility/IoCBindings.cs` wires them to concrete handlers. Prefer an existing mediator, or a new interface/mediator pair in `NINA.WPF.Base`, when a library needs UI-side behavior.

Keep reusable logic in its owning library and final shell composition in `NINA`. Shared WPF infrastructure provides reusable components; the executable decides how to assemble them into screens.

### Resources And Distribution

`NINA.Core.Locale.Loc` resolves localized strings. Sequence/plugin metadata often carries `Lbl_*` keys for runtime resolution. [Localization guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md#localization) identifies the source resource and Crowdin workflow.

Runtime code relies on files under `NINA/External`, `NINA/Utility`, `NINA/Database` and `NINA/Sequencer/Examples`. New files need matching `NINA/NINA.csproj` output rules, installer authoring when shipped and test output rules when used by tests. Dependency changes also require synchronizing the two license inventories listed in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#resources-and-distribution).

## Verification And Durable Knowledge

Use the [testing map](.agents/skills/nina-repository/references/testing-map.md#routing-table) to select fixtures for the changed boundary. Numerical astronomy changes need reference-value and boundary coverage; WPF changes may require compiled view/template construction; plugin and persistence changes need compatibility checks.

Record durable architectural changes in the owning document. Where practical, enforce recurring contracts with tests or analyzers. User-facing changes may also need `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and documentation in `NINA.Docs`; see [contribution guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md).
